1) What is Container Image ?
============================
Definition: A container image is a package of software that includes everything that is needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and its dependencies. 
            Images are commonly built using Dockerfile (AKA Containerfile), and commonly provided through image registries.
Purpose: To create and run containers consistently across different environments.
Example: A Docker image for a Python web application might include Python runtime, application code, and required libraries.

2) What is Container ?
======================
Definition: A lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, such as code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.
Purpose: To ensure consistent and reliable deployment across different environments.
Example: Running a web application inside a Docker container ensures it runs the same way on a developer’s laptop as on a production server.

3) What is Container Runtime ?
==============================
Definition: The software that runs and manages containers on a host system.
Purpose: To provide the necessary tools and libraries to run and manage containerized applications.
Example: Docker is a popular container runtime that allows you to create, run, and manage containers.

4) Difference between Virtual Machines and Containers ?
=======================================================
"Virtual machines (VMs) virtualize hardware and run a full operating system, leading to higher resource usage. 
For example :
-------------
  Running three VMs means running three OS instances. Containers, however, share the host OS kernel and are managed by a container runtime, making them lightweight. 
  Running three containers means they share the same OS, using fewer resources. This efficiency makes containers faster and more scalable than VMs."

5) Understanding Container Engines ?
====================================
   In the early days of containers (2014/2015), containers were started and managed by a container engine.
   A container engine offers multiple components
   A core component that runs the containers
   Optionally a daemon that controls the containers
   A command line interface
   Common container engines include and included
     > Docker: The most well-known container engine, Docker simplifies container creation and management with a robust CLI and daemon (Docker daemon) for running and managing containers.
     > LXC (Linux Containers): An early containerization method, LXC provides a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment features, offering lightweight virtualization without the overhead of a full VM.
     > Podman: A daemonless container engine, Podman emphasizes security and simplicity, allowing users to run containers as non-root users without requiring a central daemon.
     > systemd-nspawn: Part of the systemd suite, systemd-nspawn is used for running containers in a simple and straightforward way, often used for testing and debugging system images.

6) What are docker image layers and how they work and which layer will excecute first and which layer execute next and last ?
==============================================================================================================================
    Docker images are composed of multiple layers. Each layer represents a specific instruction in the image's Dockerfile.
    When you build an image, each instruction in the Dockerfile adds a new layer on top of the previous one.
 Layer Execution:
 ----------------
   Base Image Layer: Docker pulls the base image ubuntu:20.04.
   Package Installation Layer: Installs package1 and package2, creating a new layer.
   Copy Layer: Copies application files into /app, creating another new layer.
   Working Directory Layer: Sets /app as the working directory, another new layer.
   Expose Port Layer: Specifies port 8080 to be exposed, adding another layer.
   Entrypoint Layer: Sets the entrypoint to python3 app.py, creating the final layer.

7) What is a dockerfile ?
=========================
    A Dockerfile is a text document that contains a set of instructions or commands that Docker uses to assemble an image.

8) What is k8s ?
================
   Definition: An open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.
   Components:
     Master Node: Manages the Kubernetes cluster.
     Worker Nodes: Run the application workloads.

9) What are Pods ?
==================
   Definition: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A pod represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster.
   Characteristics: A Pod Can contain one or more containers, shared storage, and network resources.

10) What is Replication Controller/ReplicaSet ?
==============================================
  Definition: Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
  Difference: ReplicaSet is the next-generation Replication Controller.

11) What is Deployments ?
========================
  Definition: Provides declarative updates to applications and manages ReplicaSets.

12) Services in K8s ?
======================
  Definition: An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of pods as a network service.
  Types:
    ClusterIP: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP.
    NodePort: Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port.
    LoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.

13) What are ConfigMaps and Secrets ?
=====================================
   ConfigMaps: Store configuration data as key-value pairs.
   Secrets: Store sensitive data like passwords and API keys.

14) What are Jobs and CronJobs ?
================================
  Jobs: Manages batch processing jobs.
  CronJobs: Manages scheduled jobs.

15) What is Ingress ?
=====================
  Definition: Manages external access to services, typically HTTP.
  Components: Ingress Controller, Ingress Resources.

16) What is Network Policies ?
=============================
  Definition: Controls the communication between pods.

17) Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) ?
=====================================
   Definition: Automatically scales the number of pods based on CPU utilization or other select metrics.

18) Cluster Autoscaler ?
========================
   Definition: Automatically adjusts the size of the Kubernetes cluster based on the resource usage.

19) Service Mesh ?
===================
   Definition: A dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication.
   Tools: Istio, Linkerd.
20) Best practices to create docker images smaller :
=====================================================
    Use Minimal Base Images : Start with a minimal base image like alpine which is about 5 MB. Be cautious of compatibility issues with some software.
    Avoid Storing Secrets in Images : Use Environment Variables: Avoid including secrets or sensitive data in the Docker image. Use environment variables or Docker secrets instead.
    Minimize Layers :  Combine Commands: Reduce the number of layers by combining multiple commands into a single RUN statement.
    -----------------
        RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install -y package1 package2 && \
        rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
    Multi-Stage Builds :  
    ---------------------
            FROM golang:1.16-alpine AS builder
            WORKDIR /app
            COPY . .
            RUN go build -o myapp

            FROM alpine
            WORKDIR /app
            COPY --from=builder /app/myapp .
            ENTRYPOINT ["./myapp"]
    21) Aprroches to create a docker images 
    ========================================
         There are two main approaches you can use: creating images from a running container or using a Dockerfile
              Using a running container: a container is started, and modifications are applied to the container. From the container, docker commands are used to write modifications
              Using a Dockerfile: a Dockerfile contains instructions for building an image. Each instruction adds a new layer to the image. This offers more control over what files are added to which layer.
